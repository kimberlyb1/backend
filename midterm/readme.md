Mid term madness... 

The client is completely built out for you, 
Nothing has been done to the server... 
Build a server from scratch
Connect Mongoose
Make your routes and logic in order to achive CRUD

There should be a 
.get
.post
.put
.delete

Don't forget your dependacies,  cors, dotenv, express and mongoose
